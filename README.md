## âž¤ Walkthrough


### Built With

- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [GraphQL](http://graphql.org)
- [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Socket IO](https://socket.io/)
- [Angular](https://angularjs.org/)
- [Electron JS](https://electronjs.org/)
- [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)


### Build System
NG6 uses NPM scripts, Gulp, and Webpack together for its build system. Yes, you don't need Gulp if you're using Webpack. This is true if your build system is only responsible for file manipulation. However, ours is not.

`Webpack` handles all file-related concerns:
* Transpiling from ES6 to ES5 with `Babel`
* Loading HTML files as modules
* Transpiling stylesheets and appending them to the DOM
* Refreshing the browser and rebuilding on file changes
* Hot module replacement for transpiled stylesheets
* Bundling the app
* Loading all modules
* Doing all of the above for `*.spec.js` files as well

`Gulp` is the orchestrator:
* Starting and calling Webpack
* Starting a development server (yes, Webpack can do this too)
* Generating boilerplate for the Angular app

**Check out the [JSPM version](https://github.com/angularclass/NG6-starter/tree/jspm)--an alternative to Webpack as an ES6 build system.**

### File Structure

```
src/
 â”œâ”€â”€app/                   * WebApp: folder, our source files that will be compiled to javascript
 â”‚   â”‚--shared/            * Do put all shared files within a component feature in a shared folder.
 |   |   |-- exception.service.ts
 |   |   |-- exception.service.spec.ts
 |   |   |-- shared.module.ts * shared module with all shared declarations and providers
 |   |   |-- index.ts             * barrel file
 â”‚   |--app.module.ts      * angular module
 â”‚   |--app.component.ts   * root component
 â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€app.spec.ts        * a simple test of components in app.ts
 â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€index.ts           * barrel file
 â”‚   â”‚
 â”‚â”€â”€assets/                * static assets are served here
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€icon/              * our list of icons from www.favicon-generator.org
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€images/            * our custom app images
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€service-worker.js  * ignore this. Web App service worker that's not complete yet
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€robots.txt         * for search engines to crawl your website
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€human.txt          * for humans to know who the developers are
 |â”€â”€main.ts        * our entry file for our browser environment
 â”‚
 |â”€â”€index.html     * Index.html: where we generate our index page
 â”‚
 |â”€â”€polyfills.ts   * our polyfills file
 â”‚
 |â”€â”€vendor.ts      * our vendor file
 |
 â””â”€â”€globals.d.ts   * our custom global type definitions
```

### Testing Setup
All tests are also written in ES6. We use Webpack to take care of the logistics of getting those files to run in the various browsers, just like with our client files. This is our testing stack:
* Karma
* Webpack + Babel
* Mocha
* Chai

To run tests, type `npm test` in the terminal. Read more about testing [below](#testing).


[![-----------------------------------------------------][colored-line]](#installation)

## âž¤ Getting Started

### Dependencies
Tools needed to run this app:
* `node` and `npm`

#### Install Node.js

Node.js is an environment that can run JavaScript code outside of a web browser and is used to write and run server-side JavaScript apps. Node.js installation includes `npm`, the package manager that allows you to install NPM modules from your terminal. 
You can download an installer from the [Node.js homepage](https://nodejs.org/en/).

##### Check your Node.js installation

Check that you have the minimum required version installed by running the following command:

```sh
node -v
```

You should see a version larger than Node 10.

```sh
node -v
v12.14.0
```

> Project name' minimum supported Node.js version is Node 10, but more recent versions will work as well.


### Installing
* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install` to install dependencies

### Running the App
NG6 uses Gulp to build and launch the development environment. After you have installed all dependencies, you may run the app. Running `npm start` will bundle the app with `webpack`, launch a development server, and watch all files. The port will be displayed in the terminal.
 
#### Tasks
Here's a list of available tasks:
* `npm run build`
  * runs Webpack, which will transpile, concatenate, and compress (collectively, "bundle") all assets and modules into `dist/bundle.js`. It also prepares `index.html` to be used as application entry point, links assets and created dist version of our application.
* `npm run serve`
  * starts a dev server via `webpack-dev-server`, serving the client folder.
* `npm run watch`
  * alias of `serve`
* `npm start` (which is the default task that runs when typing `gulp` without providing an argument)
  * runs `serve`.
* `npm run component`
  * scaffolds a new Angular component. [Read below](#generating-components) for usage details.
  
### Testing
To run the tests, run `npm test`.

`Karma` combined with Webpack runs all files matching `*.spec.js` inside the `app` folder. This allows us to keep test files local to the component--which keeps us in good faith with continuing to build our app modularly. The file `spec.bundle.js` is the bundle file for **all** our spec files that Karma will run.

Be sure to define your `*.spec.js` files within their corresponding component directory. You must name the spec file like so, `[name].spec.js`. If you don't want to use the `.spec.js` suffix, you must change the `regex` in `spec.bundle.js` to look for whatever file(s) you want.
`Mocha` is the testing suite and `Chai` is the assertion library. If you would like to change this, see `karma.conf.js`.

#### Examples

It's always easier to learn something if you have an examples. Here is a list of repos which based on this starter:

 - [TodoMVC Example App](https://github.com/AngularClass/NG6-todomvc-starter)

### Usage

Run the `node_modules/.bin/readme generate` command and a README file will be generated for you. If you want to go into depth with the readme command, check out the following options or write `node_modules/.bin/readme generate -h` in your terminal if that's your cup of tea.
